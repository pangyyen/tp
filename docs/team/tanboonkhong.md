### Project: CareCentral

CareCentral is an app designed specifically for healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and hospital staff aged between 25-60 years.
It is focused on helping healthcare professionals to manage their patients' information and appointments. While it has a GUI,
it is designed to be used via a Command Line Interface (CLI) for users who prefer typing.

### My Contributions to the Project:

Code contributed: [Reposense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tanboonkhong&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&since=2023-09-22)

- **New Features**:
    - **Prescription Management:** Implemented a feature for adding and deleting prescriptions linked to appointments. (Pull Request [#106](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-1/tp/pull/106))
      - What it does: Allows users to add and delete prescriptions for each appointment events
      - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to keep track of their patients' prescriptions,
        which is important for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions about their patients' health.
      - Highlights: The implementation was challenging in terms of adding and editing the data, as the data is stored in a list which is attributed to the 
        appointment event. The implementation required me to modify the appointment event by adding a new attribute to store the prescription. And modifying 
        it using the logic behind edit command logic.
